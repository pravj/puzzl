puzzl is an intelligent implementation of the classical sliding-puzzle game.

It's built on top of Golang's *concurrency primitives*. It uses *goroutines* and *channels* for inter process communications to provide real time notification experience in unix terminals.

puzzl comes with an in-built solver(A* powered) which can solve any puzzle configuration faster than Iron Man. :zap:
